# Rtl8812AU Realtek 802.11ac Linux Driver (rtl8812au)

This driver is an update to version 5.1.5 (rtl8812AU_linux_v5.1.5_19247.20160830) of Realtek's 8812AU USB WiFi Linux driver for AC1200 (801.11ac) adapters. 

It supports supports USB 3.0 and has been succesfully tested to work with *Linux Kernels 3.16.x to 4.12.x* as well as AMD's Radeon Open Compute (ROCm) kernel.

The original version of this driver was downloaded from [Tenda](http://www.tenda.com.cn/download/detail-2614.html).  However, several improvements have been made including support for the Tp-Link Archer and Tenda U12 dongles as well as the addition of an [LED control module (rtw_led_ctrl)](https://github.com/xxNull-lsk/rtl8812AU/pull/6#issuecomment-3261505020).
